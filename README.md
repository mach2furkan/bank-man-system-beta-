## Overview

The **Enhanced Banking System** is a robust and feature-rich C++ application designed to simulate a modern banking environment. It provides users with a wide range of banking operations, including account management, transactions, loans, joint accounts, overdraft protection, and more. The system is modular, extensible, and user-friendly, making it suitable for both beginners and advanced developers.

This project demonstrates key programming concepts such as object-oriented design, file handling, data structures (e.g., vectors, maps), and modular programming.
